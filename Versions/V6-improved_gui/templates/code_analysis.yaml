    Perform a detailed analysis of unused and dead code:
    1. List any imports that are not used in the code
    2. Identify functions or methods that are never called
    3. Find classes that are defined but not instantiated
    4. Locate commented out code blocks that should be removed
    5. Detect unreachable code blocks
    6. Identify redundant or duplicate functionality

    Additional checks:
    - Look for deprecated API usage
    - Check for outdated dependencies
    - Identify unused configuration settings
    - Find unused environment variables
    - Detect unused database fields/tables
      
    Risk assessment:
    - Dependencies on the unused code
    - Impact on test coverage
    - Backwards compatibility concerns
